# MID COURSE PROJECT ON MAVEN FUZZY FACTORY COMPANY

## SITUATION
Maven fuzzy factory has been live for 8 months approximately and our CEO has to present the company performance metrics to the board next week. 
We are asked to prepare relevant metrics to show the company's performance growth. 

This project consists of several questions we have to solve to accomplish our mission and provide valuable insights regarding the growth of the Maven Fuzzt Factory company. In this READ ME one can find the screenshots of the expected results of each question. However, the code used can be found in the attached SQL file. 

## QUESTIONS

### Question 1
**Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders to showcase the growth there?**

We can see that the number of sessions grows over time. 

### Question 2
**Next, it would be be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately.**

Brand campaigns represent someone going into the search engines and specifically looking for that particular business. Therefore, the fact that brand sessions and orders have increased
dramatically increased is a good sign.
