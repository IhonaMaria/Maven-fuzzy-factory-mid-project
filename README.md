# MID COURSE PROJECT ON MAVEN FUZZY FACTORY COMPANY

## SITUATION
Maven fuzzy factory has been live for 8 months approximately and our CEO has to present the company performance metrics to the board next week. 
We are asked to prepare relevant metrics to show the company's performance growth. 

This project consists of several questions we have to solve to accomplish our mission and provide valuable insights regarding the growth of the Maven Fuzzt Factory company. In this READ ME one can find the screenshots of the expected results of each question. However, the code used can be found in the attached SQL file. 

## QUESTIONS

### Question 1
**Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders to showcase the growth there?**

We can see that the number of sessions grows over time. 

### Question 2
**Next, it would be be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately.**

Brand campaigns represent someone going into the search engines and specifically looking for that particular business. Therefore, the fact that brand sessions and orders have increased
dramatically increased is a good sign. 

### Question 3
**While we are on gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type?**

We can see from the analysis that there are a lot more desktop sessions and desktop orders with respect to mobile. 

### Question 4
**Pull monthly trends for gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels.**

In this question, we have learned about the different types of traffic. 

- Paid traffic (like gsearch or bsearch) refers to website visitors that come to a website through paid advertising efforts. In other words, businesses or individuals pay to have their website or content displayed on various online platforms, such as search engines, social media platforms, websites, and more. The goal of paid traffic is to drive targeted visitors to a website, increasing the potential for conversions, sales, or achieving other specific goals.
  
- Organic search: Refers to the traffic that comes to a website through search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. When a user performs a search query in a search engine and clicks on a link in the search results that leads to a website, that session is counted as an organic search session. These sessions are considered "organic" because they are not influenced by paid advertising; users find the website through their natural search queries.

- Direct type-in sessions: Occur when users directly enter a website's URL into their browser's address bar or use a bookmark to access the website.

After the analysis, we can see that organic and direct-type-in sessions are growing, which is good for the business since this does not cost them money and they have the 100% benefit of the orders.
